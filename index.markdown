2023 is fast approaching. At work, you’re probably already deep into planning, setting OKRs, budgets, and headcount allocation. Your work is a well oiled machine and you spend hours and hours dedicated to make sure you have a vision and goals to work towards next year.

What if you approached your personal planning with even a 1/4 of the rigor you do your work? What if you pushed yourself to think bigger and more ambitiously than you ever have before? Think of how much you could accomplish if you dedicated time to making a vision and goals for 2023.

In this 3-hour workshop we will push you to establish an authentic vision and set ambitious goals.

You’ll also meet a new group of people who will become your cheerleaders and accountability partners.
